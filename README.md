# RapidMathsGame
Python based simple calculation game

You can run the game by simply starting the User_Interface.py file.

Functions.py file contains the basic required functions to run this game.

To configure shortcut, right click on 'Game.bat', which will open as ~
  @echo off
  py " <location to the 'User_Interface.py' file> "
 
then save changes.

Similarly edit the shortcut file to desired location and you are good to go. 

I will try to provide a video based tutorial soon.
